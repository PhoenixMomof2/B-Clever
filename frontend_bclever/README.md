# INTRODUCTION
The application has a React frontend styled with bootstrap.
The backend is a Ruby on Rails API.

This application has user authentication and authorization to control access to resources and CRUD features.

# About the application: 
I'm a mom.  I'm black.  I love to read.  But what I don't love is how racism is still so prevalent in America, so I wanted to create an app that gets some tough conversations going and gains more allies to the progressive movement.  Awaken is a collection of books I feel are a great starting point for various discussions about anti-racism, social-justice, and genuine equality in America.  While I know this is only the beginning of this application, I hope it grows and makes a positive social impact.  

## Backend Scripts
In the root project directory (AwakenBookClub), you can run:
### `bundle install` 
### `rails s` 
to get the back end going.

## Frontend Scripts
Open another terminal and in the project directory (front-end-awaken), you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start` 
to get the front end going.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
