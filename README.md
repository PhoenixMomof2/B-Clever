# INTRODUCTION
The application has a React frontend styled with Tailwindcss.
The backend is a Ruby on Rails API.

This application has user authentication and authorization to control access to resources and CRUD features.

# About the application: 
This application is a math quiz application that allows parents and their kids to sign up for accounts and keep track of and earn allowances based on the score achieved from the math quiz.  Currently, it's only addition, but I would like to add subtraction, multiplication, division, and difficulty levels down the road.  I also want to add the functionality of using the money in the wallet total allocated for wants to allow kids to create expenses, so they can see what it looks like when money is spent.  This application is meant to be a financial literacy teaching tool for elementary school aged children.

## Backend Scripts
In the root project directory (B-CLEVER), you can run:
### `bundle install` 
### `rails s` 
to get the back end going.

## Frontend Scripts
Open another terminal and in the project directory (frontend_bclever), you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start` 
to get the front end going.
